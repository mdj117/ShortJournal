        ABOUT US
            <br>
We are the official STEM Club of Jayshree Periwal International School.
Mission
The mission of the Bohring club is to cultivate an appreciation for the STEM fields amongst students in high school. It is to integrate STEM fields in a manner that will inspire kids to take up STEM as a part of their daily school routine, be it through academic courses or activities. Moreover, we believe that through Bohring kids’ love for science not only grows tenfold but at the same time, they are able to contribute to society and help solve every day real world problems through the knowledge they gain through STEM. And the whole idea is to not discriminate. No one has to be an ardent lover of physics or biology to be a part. Just share a passion that the rest of us have for the world of science, technology, mathematics and engineering.

Purpose
In a day and age where the greatest innovation and the most ground-breaking research is being done amongst the studies of STEM related subjects, Bohring helps to further that drive. So many kida across the country pursue STEM-related careers without ever actually coming to love them, or finding a passion for them. We decided that this needed to change. In a country where students are often set to pursue STEM against their own wishes, we wanted them to realise that doing so can be fun; that it doesn’t have to feel like a chore. To give an outlet to students to do whatever they please within this vast world.
